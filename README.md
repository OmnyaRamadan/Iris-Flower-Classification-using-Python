# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-Python
This Data Science project utilizes Python to analyze a dataset comprising 150 records, each characterized by 5 attributes: Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Class (Species). The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on these attributes. The project aims to create a model that can help identify the correct class (species) for any given set of attribute values, making it a valuable tool for species classification tasks in botany and horticulture.
